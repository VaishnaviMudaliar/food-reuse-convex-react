# Food Reuse with Convex and React

This repository contains the code for a food management application called **Food Reuse**, which helps users track food inventory, manage expiry dates, and make informed decisions to reduce food wastage. Built using React for the frontend and Convex for backend data management, the app integrates with GitHub OAuth for secure authentication.

## Inspiration

Food wastage is a significant issue, particularly at the household level. With many households facing challenges in managing their food inventory effectively, a large amount of edible food ends up being discarded. The **Food Reuse** app is designed to address this problem by providing users with tools to track their food items, receive expiration alerts, and plan meals efficiently to minimize waste.

## Features

- **Food Inventory Management:** Add, view, and manage food items with details like quantity and expiration date.
- **Expiration Notifications:** Get timely notifications for items that are approaching their expiration date.
- **Meal Planning:** Generate meal suggestions based on the available ingredients in your inventory.
- **Secure Authentication:** Use GitHub OAuth for secure and seamless user login.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Convex
- **Authentication:** GitHub OAuth
- **AI Integration:** ChatGroq model, @langchain/core

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VaishnaviMudaliar/food-reuse-convex-react.git
   cd food-reuse-expiry
2. **Install the Convex client and server library**
To get started, install the convex package which provides a convenient interface for working with Convex from a React app.

Navigate to your app directory and install convex.
```bash
npm install convex

3. **Set up a Convex dev deployment**
Next, run npx convex dev. This will prompt you to log in with GitHub, create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.

It will also create a convex/ folder for you to write your backend API functions in. The dev command will then continue running to sync your functions with your dev deployment in the cloud.
```bash
npx convex dev

4. **Start the app**
Start the app, open http://localhost:5173/ in a browser, and see the list of tasks.


Start the app, open http://localhost:5173/ in a browser, and see the list of tasks.
```bash
npm run dev

**Usage**
Log Food Items: Use the appâ€™s interface to add new food items and manage existing ones.
Receive Notifications: Monitor notifications for upcoming expiration dates to manage your food inventory effectively.
Generate Meal Plans: Access the meal planning feature to get recipe suggestions based on your current food items.

**Challenges**
Switching from Python to TypeScript: Transitioning from Python's dynamic nature to TypeScript's static typing involved a learning curve and required adjustments to our development practices.
First-time Usage of Convex: Integrating Convex for the first time required overcoming initial setup challenges and learning its functionalities for effective data management.
